This is the v1 and v2 swagger specs for credit transfers.

A swagger specification is a language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

The specification can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.

#### API Docs
Our API specification is available at the following links.

### Client Code Generation 
The swagger codegen project, allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs and documentation automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. 

It is possible to generate client library code automatically in your language of choice using [https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).
